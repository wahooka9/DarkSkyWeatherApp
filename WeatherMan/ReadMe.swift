 This project is ment to be sample code,  It is not intended for production distribution.  It was Created / built for iOS 12.1 in Swift 4 ,  There is no intention of upkeep.
 
 My initial ideas / plan for this
 
 Use Dark Sky API  (requires you to add a link to them per their agreement)
 Use CoreLocation to get local location data of device to query the API
 
 It would be nice to have the app allow you to search for Weather in an Area -  I cant find a Free API (Dark Sky only takes Long / Lat Coords)
 
 It would be nice to have images to represent the given weather (There are no hosted images / codes - just text representation of the weather)
 
 This should be a universal app.
 
 I am not good with design -  so hopefully the UI and UX makes sense.
 
 // JSON Parsing
 // Networking
 // Image downloading / Caching  OR  Local assets
 // CoreLocation
 // Wait screen / loading
 // Caching / Persistance  -  not spamming requests.
 
 // Checks for GPS
 
 // CoreData -  User Defaults ?  is it needed?
 
 // Universal App
 // Maybe 2 Storyboards - 1 for iPad  1 for iPhone (easier to see flow)  or all on same if both have the same UI flow.
